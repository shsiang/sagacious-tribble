hello hi howdy
i'm testing this out
because dude is starting Python
and it's confusing
but it's okay

I AM A GIT MASTER!!

I think I remember Andrew using Sublime on his computer
because of the scroll thingy at the right side of the editor
except there were more colors
which made it pretty
but mine isn't because it's all white :(
fix me!

the end.

HERE ARE MORE REVISIONS
I just made an appt with a gyno heh
gross
but whatever, necessary problems, yah?

and you will swell.
This is work-appropriate conversations, yah?
