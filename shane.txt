hello hi howdy
i'm testing this out
because dude is starting Python
and it's confusing
but it's okay

I AM A GIT MASTER!!

I think I remember Andrew using Sublime on his computer
because of the scroll thingy at the right side of the editor
except there were more colors
which made it pretty
but mine isn't because it's all white :(
fix me!

the end.
